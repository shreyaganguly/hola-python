## hola-python

This repository is just a collection of the python projects that I am doing while learning python. For now, I have written a `rock-paper-scissor` game.
Just run the following command and hit off a game with your computer:

```bash
$ python rock_papers_scissors.py
```

#### Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* pytest
