## hola-python

This repository is just a collection of the python projects that I am doing while learning python. For now, I have written -

* [`rock-paper-scissor`](https://github.com/shreyaganguly/hola-python/blob/master/rock_papers_scissor) game - Play [rock paper scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors)
* [`secret-messages`](https://github.com/shreyaganguly/hola-python/blob/master/secret_messages) game - Encrypt/ Decrypt messages using [caesar-cipher](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/)

Just go to the game directory and run the following command, for e.g to play `rock-paper-scissor game`:

```bash
$ cd rock_papers_scissors
$ python rock_papers_scissors.py
```

#### Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* pytest
